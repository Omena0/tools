# Tools

Some tools that I've made for personal use.

I'll still write docs so yall can use it too.

# [<ins>proj</ins>](https://github.com/Omena0/tools/raw/refs/heads/main/dist/proj.exe "Click to download")

A tool to manage git repositories for your projects.

Usage: proj [mk|rm|mv|ls] [project name] <[new project name]>

### Examples

Create a project named `tools`
```sh
$ proj mk tools
```

List all projects
```sh
$ proj ls
```

Rename project
```sh
$ proj mv tools tools2
```

Delete the project
```sh
$ proj rm tools2
```
