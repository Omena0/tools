# Tools

Some tools i use every day.

I recommend putting these in $PATH

## Proj

Create a new project quickly.

Usage: proj [mk|rm|mv|ls] [project name]

## Countlines

Count lines of code in a directory

Counts all text files that are not in gitignore
and sorts them from highest to lowest.

Ignores dotfiles

Usage: countlines <[path]='.'>
